Below, Nyong’o’s mother, Dorothy, shares the family recipe for ugali.

Ingredients:

   Corn flour (options include the addition of small portions of millet, or sorghum, or cassava flour)
   Water

 Estimate 1 cup of corn flour and 1 1/2 cups of water per person.

Instructions:

  *You can begin by lightly roasting the flour in a dry pan. This is an extra tip, not a basic practice. But you can add that step for extra taste/success.

  Bring the water to a boil in a saucepan.

  Pour in the flour and stir continuously with a flat wooden spoon into a smooth consistency, mashing out any lumps that may form.

  Cook for eight to ten minutes, continue to stir. Reduce the heat and cover for another three minutes.

  Stir again for about two minutes and shape into a dome. It should no longer stick to the wooden spoon. It should have an aroma of roasting corn.

  Cover with a plate and flip it over onto the plate, keeping it covered to stay warm.

  Serve immediately with your favorite vegetable or meat stew. Ugali goes well with a dish that has sauce or gravy.
